# stuffyouwrote
 A framework for sharing stories or other blog style posts

This is a short and simple setup but it works fine and you can edit it to your hearts content to make it perfect. 

make sure you copy the structure as it is in the repository and change everywhere it says "yourdomain" with your domain. 

When adding a new book(post) simply ftp up your files and give them the same name minus the extension, example book1.html, book1.pdf... and so forth

You can add some crazy cool effects like CSS for example https://3dbook.xyz/ 

take a look at stuffiwrote.net to see an example of what kind of potential this has.
